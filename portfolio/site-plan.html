    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this portfolio website is to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional 
        experience, personal projects, and technical expertise. It serves as a platform to showcase my 
        skills, highlight key accomplishments, and offer insight into my journey as a software engineer. 
        This site will also act as a central hub for potential employers, collaborators, and clients to 
        connect with me, explore my work, and learn more about my passion for software development.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
        My portfolio website targets employers and recruiters seeking software engineers for international 
        or remote roles. The audience includes collaborators, peers, and tech enthusiasts in their 20s to 40s,
         interested in open-source projects and software development. Clients and freelancers, often small 
         business owners or startup founders, also seek technical expertise to address business challenges.
    </p>
    <p> 
        groups need a developer with strong technical skills who can work effectively in remote settings. 
        They often struggle to find someone who can deliver solutions and integrate into distributed teams. 
        Most will access the site via desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, so responsive design is key for 
        a smooth experience.
