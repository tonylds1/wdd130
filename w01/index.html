    <h2>Tony Moraes</h2>
    <h2>From Brazil</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Tony Moraes, and I’m originally from Brazil, where I’ve lived all my life. 
        I’m 42 years old and have always had a passion for software development. Ever since I 
        first encountered a command prompt on a Windows machine during junior school, I’ve been 
        fascinated by technology, and that fascination has guided my entire career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve spent my professional life working in software development. My journey began with a 
        company that acted as a mediator between government institutions and entrepreneurs. Later, 
        I joined firms that specialize in contracting developers and assigning them to different 
        projects. My last two positions were with such companies here in Brazil. Although my experience 
        has been local so far, I’m eager to explore international opportunities. Recently, I found a 
        job posting at Vanhack that aligns perfectly with my skills and experience. I believe I’m a 
        great fit for this role because of my extensive experience with the required technologies and 
        my proactive approach to problem-solving and system optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
        My major is Software Engineering, and over the past decade, I’ve continuously honed my skills and 
        grown as a developer. I envision my career progressing through more challenging and global projects 
        where I can apply my expertise and make a meaningful impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy following political developments, especially here in Brazil. It’s a 
        challenging and fascinating landscape, and I love learning more about it. I’ve been married for 
        13 years, and we have two wonderful kids. My family is my greatest source of support and motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m looking forward to collaborating with all of you and improving my English skills as I continue 
        working towards international opportunities. I appreciate your kindness as I work on this, and I hope 
        to contribute as much as I learn from everyone here.
